## Future Project Updates.

- Add a user portal for end-users to send tickets in via email.
- Be able to consume emails and route them to different ques automatically. 
- Allow users to change the queue to which the ticket belongs to.
- Add in a real-time reply system that would allow users to send out replies back to the user emails. 
- utilize channel broadcasting using pusher to get live updates on tickets and replies.
- Add in authentication using Laravel Jet Stream to then show tickets assigned to specific users only.

There are also many more features that I would like to continue to add to this project however the ones listed above would be 
the main focus to start.
